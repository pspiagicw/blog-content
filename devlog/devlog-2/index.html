        <h1 id="qemantra"><code>qemantra</code></h1>
<p>I have finally released <code>v0.2.1</code> of my project <code>qemantra</code>. This release removed a lot of code, made it cleaner.</p>
<p>Things I have learned while developing this release.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How to build a sexy website for any project.
Using <code>vhs</code> and <code>mdbook</code>, I made a website inspired from WezTerm, mostly it&rsquo;s homepage.
I tried to include a visual element (Picture or GIF) to improve user engagement and understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How not to complicate <code>argument parsing</code>.
When using <code>flaggy</code>, I used to have a separate struct for each subcommand, over the structs I had for actually running the program.
With <a href="https://abhinavg.net/2022/08/13/flag-subcommand/">this</a>, I eliminated flaggy and brought the good&rsquo;ol <code>flag</code> package.
I also tried to eliminate almost all other <code>struct</code>s. Now I have a single struct for the entire project. This simplifies things a lot.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I could have improved</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Testing: Even though I don&rsquo;t write a single line of code without testing, refactoring made lot of the tests not-passing.
Causing my CI/CD (<code>Github Actions</code>) to fail on every commit. I would have to re-write these tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Website deployment:
Currently deploying the <code>qemantra</code> website is a chore. I need to build, archive, transfer to my server (Using sftp) and then unarchive and restart my reverse proxy.
This is a lot of work and I would have to improve the workflow by a large margin. This is my plan over the next few days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better planning:
This release was a little mess, the website had a lot of references to the <code>v0.0.1</code> release, I had to do a little cleanup for the few days after the release.
Next time I can have a ready changelog and beautiful CI/CD pipelines to make the process easier.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="bsharp-or-b"><code>bsharp</code> or <code>b#</code></h1>
<p>This is my Lisp implementation inspired from <code>bash</code>. I finally built a hand-written recursive descent parser.
My last implementation <code>boombash</code> had no actual parser. It had a very rude implementation and had no actual AST creation.</p>
<p>With the current implementation I have finally created a proper AST. I have also started the <code>evaluator</code> work. It can evaluate strings, numbers and other simple objects.</p>
<p>Ideas I have for this project</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Write a compiler:
Once I have a working interpreter, I can have convert it into a working compiler. I am learning this while writing a VM based compiler <code>uranus</code> ( My implementation for <code>monkey</code> from <code>Writing a Interpreter/Compiler in Go.</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing a transpiler:
As <code>b#</code> is inspired from Bash and aims to replace bash scripts, transpiling to Bash script sounds like a good idea!
With this evaluation shifts to the much better bash implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding a macro system
<code>Writing a Interpreter in Go</code> has a secret chapter called <code>Writing a Macro System</code>. In keeping with this, I am also interested in making a macro system for <code>b#</code>.
Anyway every lisp is incomplete without a macro system!</p>

<p>My goals for next few days/week.</p>
<ul>
<li>Work on publishing <a href="https://github.com/golang-groom/groom"><code>groom</code></a> with a sexy website.</li>
<li>Complete <code>groom-install</code>, bringing number of subcommands to 3.</li>
<li>Maybe implement task dependency ordering using a topological sort for <code>groom-make</code>.</li>
<li>Finally complete <code>dpm</code> and <code>bbx</code>.</li>
</ul>
