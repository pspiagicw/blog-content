        <p>Welcome to my first devlog!</p>
<p>Here I would try to show what I have developed over the week! Even if the week is unproductive.</p>
<h1 id="python-backends">Python Backends</h1>
<p>Through a college project, I am getting to know the inner working of building a backend with Python.
I have only built a backend with <code>golang</code> which resulted to nothing as I scrapped the entire project.
Building a backend with Python was a great way of getting back to Python after a long time.</p>
<p>But I would say this project was one of the best project&rsquo;s I have written in a while.
Let me elaborate</p>
<h2 id="python-ecosystem">Python ecosystem</h2>
<p>The first thing that impressed me was how cohesive the Python ecosystem has become.
With the popularity of <code>poetry</code> and the usage of the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file, every tool is integrated and works with each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>poetry</code> is an project management tool for Python. It handles project creation, dependency management and even building the Python project without hassle. It&rsquo;s one of the inspiration for <a href="https://github.com/golang-groom/groom">groom</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second thing was the how easily I could use libraries like <code>fastapi</code>.
When I imagined of working with <code>Flask</code> especially for building REST API&rsquo;s I was a little disgusted.</p>
<p>Then I found out about <code>fastapi</code>. It looked similar to things I had been working with <code>golang</code>.
After the initial introduction I was hooked. I Immediately started configuring a starter repo.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>fastapi</code> is a library that enables making REST API&rsquo;s quite efficiently. If you are planning to make a REST API I would recommend <code>fastapi</code> for your next project instead of <code>Flask</code> or something heavy like <code>Django</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="autocode-bliss">AutoCode Bliss</h2>
<p>For the first time in my life, my entire repo was automated. Using tools like <code>pdoc</code> , <code>poethepoet</code> and <code>pre-commit</code>,
I had setup a simple workflow which ensured that never any  unformatted and untested code is pushed to the repository.</p>
<p>With <code>pre-commit</code> I can be confident that every commit is clean!</p>
<h3 id="why-such-precaution-">Why such precaution ?</h3>
<p>This project was not a personal project, it was a collaborative college project.
Which meant a lot of people were about to contribute and commit to the repository.
This workflow not only was enforced on myself but on everybody who wanted to contribute to the repository.</p>
<p>I knew this was needed to prevent problems in the future. I was mostly right!</p>
<h2 id="cicd">CI/CD</h2>
<p>I also integrated a simple CI/CD pipeline within the repository which would check every PR.
It would then build a docker image out of the repository and push it to <code>DockerHub</code>.</p>
<h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2>
<p>Through a friend&rsquo;s help I had set up a lightweight <code>x86</code> instance on the cloud.</p>
<p>I could run the docker image of my backend with the appropriate port forwarding.</p>
<p>But what happens when I update the image on <code>DockerHub</code>. Will I need to <code>ssh</code> into the cloud server and update the docker container manually ?</p>
<h4 id="no">NO</h4>
<p>That&rsquo;s where <code>watchtower</code> helped me. I found out about it through my self-hosting experiment and since then I have been using it regularly.</p>
<p>Basically whenever the <code>DockerHub</code> image updates, it automatically updates the local docker container with the updated image, preserving all the options like the port forwarding.</p>
<h1 id="frontend">Frontend</h1>
<p>The frontend was handled by the aforementioned friend who is a wizard of React/React Native and gladly began work.</p>
<p>Thanks to him I am confident we can complete this college project and maybe learn a thing or two about collaborative development.</p>
<p>Writing this post has given me the idea of sharing my Python project setup. I believe it is quite good and maybe helpful to others.</p>
